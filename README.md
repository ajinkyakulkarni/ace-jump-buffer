Ace Jump Buffer
--

`ace-jump-buffer` is an extension for `ace-jump-mode` and the native `bs` buffer menu that lets you hop to any of your current Emacs buffers in two key strokes: one to display the buffer menu, and one to select the line on which the buffer is on.

It also supports `perspective` to scope the buffer list to your current workspace/project.

To install, make sure `ace-jump-buffer.el`, [`ace-jump-mode.el`](https://github.com/winterTTr/ace-jump-mode), (and optionally, [`perspective.el`](https://github.com/nex3/perspective-el)) are in your load path and add the following to your Emacs init:

```
(require 'ace-jump-buffer)
(ace-jump-buffer-mode t)
```

Then bind the command `ace-jump-buffer` to a key binding of your choice and flip away.
